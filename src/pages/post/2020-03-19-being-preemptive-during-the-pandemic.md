When a thought in the back of your mind escalates from anxiety to reality faster than you can react, what do you do?

<br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago I started looking at the numbers. I didn't like how quickly things were picking up, but the US had only just gotten a couple cases and Italy seemed fine. As a few days passed, my "oh shit, is this going to be a thing" worry started to turn into reality as Italy started to pick up cases and South Korea opened drive thru testing while locking down neighborhoods.

<br/>
<br/>
After venting to some friends about how worried I was getting, I finally got up the nerve to act on my worries and talk to my long distance girlfriend about the situation. 
We agreed that just by looking at the numbers, somewhere around 50-70k cases at the time, it was obvious this was going to escalate far faster than anyone seemed to be acknowledging, and with our original plan of moving closer to each other still a few months off it seemed almost certain that we were going to have to make some hard decisions very soon.

<br/>
<br/>
In what will certainly become history in the future, the speed at which the next week passed was somehow impossibly fast and excruciatingly slow all at the same time. Italy locked down, nearly every State in the US and country in the EU reported cases.

<br/>
<br/>

After a couple stressful days I came to the conclusion to outpace the inevitable, I'd have to move up my departure from the states to March 30th. Conveniently on the Monday following my decision to leave, I was due for a yearly review with my boss. The first thing he did was ask how I was doing.

<br/>
<br/>

"At work or in life," I asked. "Overall, whichever" I'm not sure what he said exactly.
I immediately explained my position.
I think it came as a shock, not unlike this yet to be defined pandemic.
I felt an odd mix of urgency, optimism, and doubt about that date. I knew things would continue to worsen, already waaay faster than I was prepared for, but I refused to believe it would be nearly as fast as the numbers around the world indicated.

<br/>

Conversations at work quickly turned from some jokes here and there to a more serious conversation, though, some deniers held out.

<br/>
<br/>

As it turns out the 30th was a bit too optimistic and the numbers around the world were skyrocketing at a pretty uncomfortable rate. Then the US announced their travel ban. I moved my date up to the 17th and put in my resignation. Harboring doubts about the wisdom in fleeing a secure and well paying job at the advent of a global pandemic, I spoke with some higher ups. I could tell there wasn't much empathy in regard to my decision past that of my immediate supervisor. I brought up my concerns about not being able to make the trip before the inevitable and even harsher travel bans, and to be unemployed and stranded in between all of this would basically be my worst case scenario.
After being told it "doesn't seem like your priorities lay with \[the company]," It was obvious my concerns were being interpreted as preemptive and over dramatic. Though, I was told I could give my final decision on the following Monday, come Friday, this turned out to be false, as I was told then informed my resignation would be accepted and I was to check in my work and leave.

<br/>

I accepted gracefully, as I no longer had the will to fight. As I sat in my car, the weight of my decision finally sank in. I began to cry, not from regret or fear, but from relief and full understanding I would do whatever it took see my decision through to the end. I checked my flight status one more time. It had been removed from the app I was using. I started to worry. After manually entering my confirmation ID, It came back.
But this was the last straw. I had to leave as soon as possible. So, I booked a trip one last time. I had 6 hours to pack up my shit and say my goodbyes. As it turns out, this was the best possible decision I could have made.

<br/>
<br/>

On the way to the airport, I shared one last dinner with my family at a place we used to frequent while I was growing up.

<br/>

Anxiety from a delayed flight was my only worry for the next 12 hours. I exchanged stories with a local student also racing to beat the global lockdown to propose to his girlfriend in London. Never got your name my dude, hope ya made it.

<br/>
<br/>

And then ... I got to Germany. The gate personnel announced that all passengers not holding a proper passport must report to the gate. My heart dropped into my stomach, as they say.
While I was in the process of getting a residency permit, as you can tell, I didn't yet have one.
After pleading my case for a few minutes, I walked away from the gate and called my girlfriend.
She told me not to give up.
And I listened to her.
During my earlier interaction, I noticed one of the employees had a more empathetic demeanor when he was working with someone else.
I saw him as my only hope.
I pled my case once more, showed my paperwork and documents proving I had job options lined up. Hoping that would be enough.
He reluctantly printed my boarding pass, making it clear was on me if I was refused and sent home.
Boarding started, I was stopped again and insisted once more I was arriving to Norway for work.
Then, I was on the flight.
The longest 2 hours of my life ensued.

<br/>

My mind rushed with the possibility of being rejected, unemployed in an empty home I was about to lose, uninsured at the onset of a global pandemic, with the weight of uncertainty having its way with my abundance of time... I was scared. More than I can ever remember being. How would I even get home?

<br/>
We were handed forms to document our possible exposure to infectious diseases.

<br/>
<br/>

I was met by an empty airport filled with military instead of the normal passport control. Lucky to have a residence I could list for my required 14 day quarantine, I confirmed my lack of symptoms with the young soldier who was leading me. Something not so comforting was the lack of screening. No one confirmed my temperature, my symptoms, or my travel history, and, although mine was clear and my health conceivably intact, I'm certain there were others who slipped through. Others who were perhaps not so clear and healthy. I was told that if I were exposed they would inform me in 2 weeks.

<br/>

Escorted through the thin nylon ropes acting as improvised barriers, I could feel a glimmer of hope. The last soldier stepped aside to let me pass. I was through.

<br/>
<br/>

A wave of emotions rushed over me. A mix of relief, exhaustion, and joy, more than I could contain in the moment I stepped into the arrivals terminal. A simple train ride later, she met me at the station. You know those movies scenes where the couples run to each other and embrace after long and stressful ordeal of being apart? Yeah, couldn't do that.
I had to decontaminate, wash my body, my clothes, wipe down my bags.

<br/>
<br/>

But I made it, against all odds. Here's hoping this luck can continue.

**Wash your hands. Stay home.**
