When a thought in the back of your mind escalates from anxiety to reality faster than you can react, what do you do?

Two weeks ago I started looking at the numbers. I didn't like how quickly things were picking up, but the US had only just gotten a couple cases and Italy seemed fine. As a few days passed, my "oh shit, is this going to be a thing" worry started to turn into reality as Italy started to pick up cases and South Korea opened drive thru testing while locking down neighborhoods. 

<br/>
After venting to some friends about how worried I was getting, I finally got up the nerve to act on my worries and talk to my long distance girlfriend about the situation, she lives in Norway. 
We agreed that just by looking at the numbers, somewhere around 50-70k cases at the time, it was obvious this was going to get very bad very fast, and we couldn't be apart for whatever was about to go down. Though we had planned to join each other eventually, we had no idea it would be this fast. On March 6th we agreed I would 
fly out on March 30th. Things were still calm. They wouldn't be for long.

<br/>
In what will certainly become history in the future, the speed at which the next week passed was somehow impossibly fast and excruciatingly slow all at the same time. Italy locked down, nearly every State in the US and country in the EU reported cases.

<br/>

Conveniently on the Monday following my decision to leave, I was due for a yearly review with my boss. The first thing he did was ask how I was doing.

 "At work or in life," I asked.
"Overall, whichever" I'm not sure what he said exactly.
I immediately explained my position.
I think it came as a shock, not unlike this yet to be defined pandemic.
At the time, I had said I would be leaving on March 30th. I felt an odd mix of urgency, optimism, and doubt about that date. I knew things would continue to worsen, already waaay faster than I was prepared for, but I refused to believe it would be nearly as fast as the numbers around the world indicated.

Conversations at work quickly turned from some jokes here and there to a more serious conversation, though, some deniers held out. 

The next day I moved my date up to the 17th and put in my resignation. I was still too optimistic and doubted the wisdom behind fleeing a good job at the advent of a pandemic. After speaking with some higher ups I could tell there wasn't much empathy in regard to my decision past that of my immediate supervisor.
I brought up my concerns about not being able to make the trip in time to my girlfriend, and on top of that being out of a job thanks to my resignation.
I, unfortunately, lost a bit of respect for some people that day as I was told it "doesn't seem like your priorities lay with \[the company]". And he was right, they didn't. My priorities were with the ones that I loved.  Still, I was told I could give my final decision on the following Monday. Come Friday, this also turned out to be false, as I was told my resignation would be accepted and I was to check in my work and leave.

<br/>

I accepted gracefully, as I no longer had the will to fight. As I sat in my car, the weight of my decision finally sank in. I began to cry, not from regret, but from relief and full understanding I would do whatever it took.
I checked my flight status one more time. It had been removed from the app I was using. I started to worry. After manually entering my confirmation ID, It came back.
But this was the last straw. I had to leave as soon as possible. So, I booked a trip one last time, this one was 6 hours away. As it turns out, this was the best possible decision I could have made.

<br/>

I had 6 hours to prepare. I packed as much as I could, my entire life into 2 bags. Clothes and medicine were all I needed. Luckily, I have a bit of practice living out of bags.
I called my best friend so we could have one last coffee together, for a while at least. We talked, said we loved each other, and I put him in charge of my apartment.

<br/>

On the way to the airport, I shared one last dinner with my family at place we used to frequent while I was growing up. 

<br/>

A slight delay in my first flight worried me a little, but for the next 12 hours, I was positive.

<br/>

And then ... I got to Germany. 
The gate personnel announced that all passengers not holding a proper passport must report to the gate. My heart dropped into my stomach, as they say.
While I was in the process of getting a residency permit, as you can tell, I didn't yet have one. 
After pleading my case for a few minutes, I walked away from the gate and called my girlfriend. 
She told me not to give up. 
And I listened to her. 
During my earlier interaction, I noticed one of the employees had a more empathetic demeanor when he was working with someone else.
I went to him immediately.
I pled my case once more, showed my paperwork and documents proving I had job options lined up. And I pleaded some more.
He reluctantly printed my boarding pass, making it clear was on me if I was refused and sent home.
Boarding started, I insisted once more I was arriving to Norway for work.
Then, I was on the flight.
The longest 2 hours of my life ensued.

<br/>

My mind rushed with the possibility of being rejected, unemployed in an empty home I was about to lose, uninsured at the onset of a global pandemic, with the weight of uncertainty having its way with my abundance of time... I was scared. More than I can ever remember being. 

<br/>
I filled out the required form for infectious disease tracking. 

<br/>

Lucky to have a residence I could list for my required quarantine, I confirmed my lack of symptoms with the military personnel. Something not so comforting was the lack of screening. No one confirmed my temperature, my symptoms, or my travel history, and, although mine was clear and my health conceivably intact, I'm certain there were others who slipped through. Others who were perhaps not so clear and healthy. 
I was told that if I were exposed they would inform me in 2 weeks, but I was never tested by them upon entering.

<br/>

They continued escorting me through the improvised barriers ... if you can really call it that. They were nothing more than thin nylon ropes.

<br/>

A wave of emotions rushed over me. A mix of relief, exhaustion, and joy, more than I could contain in the moment I stepped into the arrivals terminal. A simple train ride later, she met me at the station. 
You know those movies scenes where the couples run to each other and embrace after long and stressful ordeal of being apart? Yeah, couldn't do that. 
I had to decontaminate essentially, wash my body, my clothes, wipe down my bags. 

<br/>

But I made it, against all odds. Here's hoping this luck can continue.

**Wash your hands.**
