<div class="article-text">

My first and only, conscious and stated, goal for this journey was to witness the Aurora Borealis. Now I find myself 15lbs lighter, 3 tattoos heavier, and in desperate need of additional storage for my phone. 

</br>

The following journey was and is partially impromptu and mostly expensive. 

</br>

From the last night home <a href="https://chanceontravel.com/post/2019-03-16-from-tennessee-to-abisko/" target="_blank">through to Abisko</a>, it was exhausting and beautiful. I made mistakes, met great people, and my eyes tried to freeze in my head, but the goal was accomplished. It was time to move on, or so I thought. A day later i receive word from a new found friend who had stayed a night longer. The Aurora had its most grandiose showing in weeks. I had just missed it. This is a common theme. One that is a little difficult to get over no matter how many times it happens.

</br>

Running into familiar faces after <a href="https://chanceontravel.com/post/2019-03-22-69-6492%C2%B0-n-a-proper-visit-to-tromso-norway/" target="_blank"> Tromso </a> became almost expected. This kind of thing is common while solo traveling, people tend to make similar plans, and the odds of running into someone starting a parallel or familiar trip at the same time is pretty high (sorry zealots of fate and destiny. that hostel wasn't empty before you arrived)

</br>

Anyway, my journey began to mirror some recent friend's, I was fed suggestions, we aligned plans, as tends to happen. This funnel of advice led me to book a stay on my first ferry and miss my first ferry. The second most stressful <a href="https://chanceontravel.com/post/2019-03-26-what-its-like-to-miss-your-hurtigruten-in-sortland-norway/" target="_blank">single event</a> of my trip, which is great in retrospect. 

</br>

**Lesson Learned**

</br>

Don't let the temptation of tubed cheese and bacon abate the doubts regarding the departure of the ship bearing all your worldly possessions. In the end, a weathered taxi driver Jason Statham'd me to the next port for a distressing amount of money. I was rewarded that night with some of the most beautiful views of my life (Svolvaer) and resolved to return.

<div class="article-text">

At the end of my Hurtigruten excursion, the ship landed, and I disembarked to Trondheim. At this point I had only been alone for 2 days.

</br>

A gift and curse I suffer from is finding comfort in loneliness. As time sequestered passes, it becomes easier to disregard connection and exchange. This is what continues through my experience in Trondheim. Aside from a pleasant encounter with a newly trained barista, I was artificially and voluntarily isolated for 3 more days. The room I checked into, empty, and the hostel commons all but deserted. With a surly Norwegian receptionist, I was all but guaranteed to discover the city alone. <a href="https://chanceontravel.com/post/2019-04-21-how-to-spend-a-practical-48-winter-hours-in-trondheim/" target="_blank">Regardless, it ended up becoming one of the most charming cities I've visited. 
</a>I also had plenty of time to empty the "free" cupboards and get in some culinary crafts.

</div>

<div class="article-text">

After that week I had become predictably isolated and the expectations set in. 

</br>

What expectations? 

</br>

The ones I leverage against myself, obviously. 

</br>

"You're supposed to be meeting people and making friends. You're just walking city streets alone, what are you doing?"

</br>

"Why aren't you being funny and sociable. Stop being quiet and awkward every time you speak with someone."

</br>

"This isn't what you wanted. Try harder. Put in more effort. Be better."

</br>

On and on.  Ad infinitum. 
Procrastination becomes my escape.

</br>

Then the cycle comes to its inevitable crescendo. I reach the same conclusions and self authored script.

</br>

 l attempt to accept myself when I can, process the thoughts I habitually abate and postpone, and gain a couple treasured days of clarity.

</br>

After a commonly uncomfortable overnight train those clear days revealed themselves in Oslo, a very accurately and appropriately understated city. Here, I had the opportunity to share a number of home cooked meals, conversations, and a night out with an awkward group of guys far too willing to let me waste money on cocktails while listening to 80s throwbacks. Oh, and I snagged a tattoo.

A great shop with even greater people. We'll grab that drink next time I come through, I promise.

</br> 

On to Bergen. 

</br>

Not often will I recommend a specific route to any destination, aside from general money saving advice, but before you trip on that new contemporary rug in the bathroom and die from blunt force toilet bowl trauma, please take the train from Oslo - Bergen before you die. 

</br>

I digress. 

</br>

## Bergen

</div>

<div class="article-image">

![rainy bergen street](https://ucarecdn.com/3e566f9c-5fd5-4a7a-86fa-8d36bab11981/-/resize/1000x/-/quality/lighter/ "rainy bergen street")

</div>

<div class="article-text">

The depressing hipster city of Norway. 
Where betting on bringing that rain coat has 3:1 odds.

</br>

Another time where paths mirrored. Most of my time in Bergen was spent with familiar faces from the North. Tromso, specifically.

</br>

I met up with several fellow wanderers with not much time to take in the city alone. 

</br>

Thinking back, this is probably where I began to lose sight of the purpose of my trip. Not to say I shouldn't have spent my time with anyone; moreso, to recall the how easy it is to slip into habitual mental spaces. 

</br>

 I tend to put what I perceive as the expectations others may have, over my own well being and even the actual circumstances involved. Meaning, I can be overly agreeable and accommodating when I really don't need to be and, in common cases, an actual detriment. This ends up being mentally exhausting to the point where, at times, I don't much live in the moment. I become too caught up in my own mental storm to just 'be'. So, there comes a time where I have to disconnect and reevaluate myself and my goals. Kind of like emptying my mental Windows 98 recycle bin and starting from a clean reset. 

</br>

Coffee shops, hikes, cake, and the perfect exhibit of Norwegian dance moves to indie rock, Bergen was the last civilized stop before the Faroe Islands. A place I had never even heard of that I booked based on recommendation alone. 

</br>

## Stay tuned...
