## Hostels

Where university students are lured into sex slavery and house orgies are a nightly occurrence only occasionally spiced up by the odd backpack guitarist.

</br>

But you want a good hostel.

</br>

I've been to …. A couple at this point. I’d like to think I’ve gained enough knowledge to guide you in the right path, or at the very least teach you how to ask google where you should lay your head and valuables for a night or 4.

</br>

First. Hostels are fine. Forget the stereotypes you think you know, They’re mostly wrong, unless you’re right, then good job. Aside from the occasional room of sleep apnea patients, hostels are safe, communal places that are ideal for a solo traveler and mediocre for everyone else. Most offer private rooms if you’re afraid of people sleeping near you, and gender specific rooms for peace of mind.

</br>

So let’s figure out how to sift through the thousands of death traps and find that dream hostel.

## PRICE

For obvious reasons this is going to be a balancing act with price taking a central role. Think of price as a rubber band that will reign in our expectations… wait or the reigns on a horse that reign the horse. Actually, pretend you’re a horse and price is your set of reigns… yeah.

## EXPERIENCE

What kind of experience are you looking to have? If all you’re concerned about is getting lit and going out with strangers, the franchise hostels are fine, but there are some issues.

</br>

Your “Generator Hostels” of the world:

* They’ll charge you for basically everything shy of standing in the room
* They don’t effectively plan group activities (typically)
* There will be 3 million people. Getting lost in the crowd is a real possibility if you’re socially anxious.

</br>

I tend to prefer the smaller, locally owned and operated hostels:

* More down to earth community atmosphere, more like a little family 
* Fewer guests so it’s more likely to get a personal experience
* Typically around locals with the best advice
* More properly curated activities and events

## REVIEWS

Cross reference reviews from sites like Hostelworld, <a href="https://www.booking.com/s/34_6/871fccd7">Booking.com</a>, google reviews.

</br>

 Be on the lookout more for the amount of reviews that the overall rating. If the hostel has 4 or more stars, it will probably be a safe bet.

</br>

Read the worst reviews first. Typically, it will be someone complaining about an annoyance that is pretty insignificant, but this is where the worst of issues can be quickly highlighted, e.g. hygiene related trouble (plumbing, unusable showers), reasonably bad customer service, and the worst offender, UNUSABLE WIFI.

</br>

Check that instagram. Is it active? Does it look like they portray a good atmosphere? Are there comments that praise the hostel (not from employees)
.

## LOCATION

<div class="article-text">

**Here’s a quick tip.** Always figure out the good neighborhoods to stay in.

</br>

The last thing you want is a 45 minute commute back to your hostel every night, having no options for food, or, even worse, having to walk 20 minutes everyday just to get to the nearest metro station.

</br>

Normally it’s as easy as googling “Best neighborhoods in xxx.”

</br>

Other settings to keep in mind: 

* Is it central?
* Is it close to public transit? Metro, tram, ferry, bus, bikes?

## MISC.

* What do they offer for free?
* Free breakfast
* Kitchen
* TOWELS
* Linen
* Earplugs
* Luggage storage
* Hair dryers
* Is there an en-suite shower? (these are always nice)
* Do they plan activities often?
* How accommodating are they? From late night bookings to directions from the airport. It’s great to find a place with good recommendations that responds promptly. 

## THE PROCESS

There is a benefit to booking ahead. There will always be more options and the price is unlikely to fluctuate anyway. If you know when you’re going to be in a city, it’s best to go ahead and press that button.

</br>

Most hostels will also offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before your booking date. SO, if you’re like me and afraid of commitment, you’ve got a way to escape, I mean change your mind.

</br>

Cross reference using Hostelworld and booking.

</br>

Always check the properties website last as they might have a cheaper booking since the other providers charge them a fee.

</br>

Weigh the benefit of your preferences. Maybe that great location is a bit more every night, or that cozy looking hostel with the mascot cat is a 10 minute walk from the station.

</br>

My best hostel recs:

</br>

<a href=”http://www.vagabondsbelfast.com/”>Vagabonds</a>

 Belfast, Ireland

</br>

More memories in 2 weeks than you'll normally have in years. This place knows how to party and won't give you a choice. The fun group of staff is world class and you'll leave wondering how you survived, in the best of ways.

<div class="article-text">

<a href="https://hostel-downtown.cz/en/">Hostel DownTown</a>

Prague, Czech Republic

</br>

Dinners, puppet shows, and drinking games. It's hard to ask for much more this close to Charles Bridge.

<a href=”https://app.onda.me/v2/booking/thathouse”>That.House</a>

 Seoul, SK

</br>

A unique hostel run by some fun locals who will go out of there way to make sure you feel at home. Expect improvised parties, home cooking, and nights filled with k-pop music videos in one of the best neighborhoods in Seoul.
