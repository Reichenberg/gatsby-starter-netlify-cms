  A day full of coincidences and scenarios that had the potential to become far
  worse! Wrong buses, lost tickets, friendly people, and beautiful views. Oh,
  and it's my first article.

woke up early, did the body moving thing 

* planned the journey (SCREEN SHOTS AND ALL)
* BOUGHT A TICKET without wifi-for some reason
* wasted $4, so whatever.
* figured out the route(420 to eidkjosen)
* THEN 425 to ersfjordbotn
* got off past the school
* passed a woman shoveling snow, didn't think much of it, took some pics, headed back down the winding trail
* Noticed the woman, who i'll now refer to as "Maria" cause that was her name. Seemed a bit winded. After some pleasantries I could tell she probably would enjoy some help, and my bus was not slated to arrive for several hours. SO, I tossed on the old workin' hands and grabbed a shovel. After a little time and what some might call "effort" we freed the volvo from it's snow shackles. 
* She was incredibly grateful and lamented how her son had been sick and a little lonely and now she would be able to go and visit him.  As we said our goodbyes she mentioned how she would love to offer me lunch, but her house was in disarray. She reached into her pocket and attempted to hand me 100NOK, like $12. I politely declined at least 3 times at which point I determined it would be rude to continue, so I accepted(this bit is important)

Feeling pretty jazzed after my impromptu encounter, I made headway down the ice laden road, hopped off the well-trodden path to snap some memories of the occasion and scenery, and stumbled onto a picturesque dock near a school. And I don't mean these fish.

I look to my right while on the dock.. BAM

Antique/hipster-ish coffee shop and bakery.

 I was sold immediately. She recommended the cinnamon bun(of course) and I wholeheartedly obliged.
