##  "Slow down"

That was a phrase strangers told me. Well, people strange enough to be traveling alone.

</br> 

That's what I was supposed to do on this windswept chain of islands. 

</div>

I was only here because of a tip from a friend I met in <a href="https://chanceontravel.com/post/2019-03-22-69-6492%C2%B0-n-a-proper-visit-to-tromso-norway/" target="_blank"> Tromso </a> . We were to meet on the islands. I arrived at the single runway airport a day or so ahead of them, very worn out from both my sleepless Bergen experience and chain of trains, buses, and ferries. 

</br>

Confused and quickly coming to terms with with the lack of transit to my hostel, I had three options. 

</br>

1. $40 airport taxi 4 miles down the road.

 **HA, NEXT.**

2. Wait 1.25 hours for the next bus

3. Walk

</br>

I was prepared to wait as I was detailed my options by the tourist information clerk. 

</br>

A pause.

</br>

A glance towards a weathered watch. 

</br>

"I get off now. I will take you."

</br>

I was off to a good start. 

</br>

I was slowing down, making plans, and bearing witness to some of the most beautiful views in the world. We rented a car from the owner of the hostel at a rate 75% cheaper than anywhere else. It is by far the best way to explore the islands. Splitting rental costs with new friends became the norm.

Nights were relaxing. A kitchen stocked with appliances and refreshingly functional stove tops thanks to the owner's past cooking needs, I was able to pursue my culinary interest once more. Finishing off the duty free alcohol became a group goal. The occasional night of Aurora hunting graced us. Something that came as a surprise to everyone, and only becoming known thanks to a smoke break and a Google search confirmation. Those were apparently not glowing green clouds. 

</br>

For all intents and purposes, aside from hiking mountains for 15 miles a day and an alarming amount of pain that cursed my knee, it was relaxing; however . . .

</br>

A balance I've yet to master, working towards goals and relaxing. I have a tendency to gain a singularly focused mindset when pursuing a goal, travel, that I most inevitably forget the requirements that plague the rest of life, leading to a buildup of unresolved emotions and plans.  On the opposing side, relaxing and procrastinating. These are the moments you should reflect and repair. 

</br>

Resolve the tension in your mind to prepare for the periods that require focus. Is what I would tell someone else. More often than not, I find myself criticizing for not fully committing to one or the other. 

</br>

> "You could be doing something better with your time. Remember that article you wanted to write, that feature you wanted to code. Your phone is full. Go through those photos. Oh your declining physical health. Go exercise right now. Don't forget you have no where to stay after Faroe. You needto think aboutwhereyoure goingtostay.yourenotmakinganymoneyyoushouldbecarefulfindajobwhereareyougoingtomorrowhffikbdykjcr6ikgd..."

Meditation helps

</br>

Writing helps

</br>

This . . . 

</br> 

Sometimes helps.

</br>

I left the islands with goodbyes from a wonderful group. 

</br>

##  Copenhagen . . .

<div class="article-text">

 . . . was a city I wasn't able to fully appreciate. In retrospect, it was a great time. Fantastic food, parks, castles.

</br>

I used this as my first experiment with Couchsurfing's "Hangouts" feature. 

</br>

Let me explain. 

</br>

Couchsurfing is an app where women are constantly offered free accommodation from men holding the hope that eventually they will find love or a fun night. The function "hangouts" in couchsurfing is where 15 guys try to show off for 2 women who probably don't care about that one time you did some thing somewhere that one time.

</br>

**Hyperbole**

</br>

But

</br>

This is the app that filled the next few days of my life and drained my social battery like Pokemon Go did to my phone battery in 2016. 

</br>

Do I recommend it if you really want someone to spend your time with? 

</br>

Yes. 

</br>

Do I recommend it if you're someone just looking for a friend and can just walk up to a timid stranger in the hostel commons and say "hi"?

</br>

**No.**  Nothing beats natural connection. 

</br>

Once I was done with that social experiment, I lacked the will or want to engage, unfortunately for a friend I was meeting. 

</br>

Despite my less than ideal mindset, Copenhagen wouldn't let me have a mediocre experience. During one of my many ritual coffee journeys I had an unexpected encounter. 

</br>

Disembarking from my hostel, eyes down, examining the route google maps had crafted for my bean adventure, the unmistakable scent of smoke passed through me. I lifted my head to see a small plume of it lifting between a few buildings in the distance. In the very path google insisted I take. Not to be one to question the almighty, I continued onward no more than block. 

</br>

Approaching, there's clearly a crowd forming. The smoke intensifying and sounds of glass being thrown, I round the corner. 

</br>

At this point, pure curiosity takes over. wooden pallets, bikes, and garbage had been ignited in protest. A group of rioters were being pursued by police and my first inclination was to film what I was witnessing. 

</br>

Down that same street, I can hear shots of some kind being fired. In all reality these were more than likely rubber bullets or bean bags, but I had no way of knowing at the time. Passing the still burning metaphoric bonfire, I shimmy past a few more people, closer to the riot. More shots go off, the woman in front of me screams, I see tear gas burst in my direction and hasten a retreat.

</div>

<div class="article-text">

In an effort to trap the rioters, a caravan of riot vans and gear-fitted police storm the road. I'm shoved back and head in the direction I came. Rounding the corner, I see a group of masked men sprinting down the next road. They see me recording.

</br>

Two of the rioters run up to me. I'm told to put my phone away and delete the video. I'm hit immediately with a lecture explaining their view. A man burned the Quran in their neighborhood and they weren't too pleased about it.

</br>

Having gotten my fill of tear gas and fire. I decided I should get that coffee.

</br>

Through the night, the riots outside my hostel increased. The sound of helicopters could be heard all night. Fires dotted the streets, cars exploded, and arrests were made. 

</br>

I slept clothed and packed that night. Now that I think about it... I've been sleeping in jeans a lot since that night.

</br>

**For fear of being long winded, I'll recap Copenhagen properly in another post. Full of recommendations and junk.**

**But, for now. the personal junk**

* Best cookies of my life

<div class="article-text">

* Fantastic pastries
* picnics I'll never forget
* the little mermaid is really overrated
* some very sad goodbyes
* I ... charisma checked my way into the Bolten's food court press day. Exceptional free food and cocktails for me that night. Shout out to the The Fish Project for my first Lobster and Caviar, and the 2 other times the chef insisted I have more.

</div>

<div class="article-text">

* Hunted down the best kebab of my life* Biked down the coast, along Amager beach to get ice cream in Dragor.
* Took a day trip to visit my first Ikea across the border in Malmo, Sweden to try Swedish meatballs. 
* Tracked down the cherry blossom bloom in a graveyard

Copenhagen was packed. Full of experience and emotions I didn't expect, reinforcing the difficulty of relaxing while wandering. Goodbyes never get easy. 

</br>

But now I needed to look forward to a long awaited hello. Specifically to my longest distance friend studying in Hong Kong. We would soon be starting a new journey together through Asia.

</br>

What's better than 3 weeks of karaoke and logistics?
