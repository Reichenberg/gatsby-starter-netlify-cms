​
Trondheim, once a viking capital, it dates back to the 11th century.
Kings ruled over this land repelling invasions from fortresses and displaying heads upon spikes. The cafe lined cobbled streets now give way to the tread of bicycle tires where in centuries past Norse warriors prepared themselves to sail, pillage, and conquer. Though, you just want a kanelboller. I've got the hookup for you. With a budget minded guide to this cozy Norwegian city. 

## DAY 1:

​

You're fresh of the boat at 6am, but not fresh, you're exhausted because it was a boat and it was full of...<a href="https://chanceontravel.com/post/2019-03-26-what-its-like-to-miss-your-hurtigruten-in-sortland-norway/" target="_blank">stressful situations </a>
​<br/>
<br/>
You need coffee, I need coffee. Google up a couple top ten lists. BAM <a href="https://www.jacobsensvart.no/" target="_blank">JACOBSEN OG SVART</a> locally roasted and highly praised, but... you get a new barista...
​
​<br/>
Though, she's nice, and offers a cup of her training coffee. Still good, and free! After a ton of caffeine and the daily guilty kanelboller (cinnamon bun), you've done your research, and no one kicked you out because this is a fantastic coffee shop.

</div>
<div class="article-text">
​
Freshly charged and energized, time to see some of this ancient city.

​​<br/>
<br/>
Follow what will now be your major point of reference. The Nidelva River. Through the eastern part of town you'll find an oddly empty hostel. Here at The Trondheim Vanderhjem you'll have a 4 person room to call yours and save plenty of money by cooking in the onsite kitchen, using a plethora of complimentary ingredients such as:

<br/>
<br/>
* Mayonnaise
* Salt
* Strawberry Jam
* Vinegar
* and Oats!

​<br/>
<br/>
​
After an incredible lack of guidance from the most apathetic receptionist in the world. Head back into town because it's only 3pm.
​
<br/>
​<br/>
You're in the fashion of saving money, and what's the best way to enjoy a city on the cheap? Look at stuff. Which stuff is first in this Viking Capital? Some old shit.
​
<br/>
​<br/>
Follow your trusty guide, the Nidelva, down to a a neighborhood known as BAKKLANDET. An old set of cobblestone streets and wooden buildings that used to house viking warriors and families.
​

![bakklandet](https://ucarecdn.com/fef98c0c-842a-4958-adf4-a1cc4202a09c/-/resize/1000x/-/quality/lighter/ "bakklandet")

</div>
<div class="article-text">
​
Now home to coffee shops and students. The tread of bike tires tends to be less demanding than a raiding party. On that note. Trondheim has an unparalleled cycling infrastructure.
​<br/>
<br/>
​
That is mostly out of service until May... or April.. but this is March. As you'll come to find out, March happens to be a less than ideal time to visit this city.
​
<br/>
​<br/>


**NOW.**
​
<br/>
​<br/>
You're finished admiring the fresh ground beans and local starving art installations.
​​<br/>

The Old town bridge, or Gamle Bybro if you're cultured, is close by. 
<br/>
<br/>

Redesigned, reengineered, and repurposed countless, like 3, times. In years past, give or take 200 or so, you'd be met by military guards and kindly asked to pay a toll.

<br/>
<br/>
Now, in 2019, you can admire this strategic military crossing with your fresh cappuccino unabated.

</div>
<div class="article-text">
​
From here you'll get a view of the lumber lined canal, and your next destination past the bridge on your left.

<br/>

**NIDAROS Cathedral.**
​

</div>
<div class="article-image">

![Nidaros Cathedral](https://ucarecdn.com/fcc15f2c-a8e0-4d8c-94c2-76f11b6a66a9/-/resize/1000x/-/quality/lighter/ "Nidaros Cathedral")

</div>
<div class="article-text">
​
A highlight is an understatement. What my uneducated guess would call a Gothic cathedral stands before you. One of the most beautiful in Norway, and probably the world.

​<br/>
<br/>
Admire it for as long as you deem worthy, since this happens to be the burial site of King Olav II...the patron saint of Norway.
<br/>
​<br/>

If you're still up for walking, and of course you are because it's cheaper than the buses, lets head a bit farther north, past the fine shopping and Michelin restaurants.
<br/>
​<br/>

and towards Stiftsgården, where you'll admire ALL THE CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE IT'S MARCH AND NOT MAY.


​<br/>

**NEXT**

​<br/>
West, along Kongens gate, you're headed to a more understated section of the city, filled with street art and more churches. Ilen Kirke will greet you, with approximately 2.3 million crows circling over head.
​

</div>
<div class="article-text">
​
Once you've had your fill of walking stop by any of the local grocers on the way back to your abysmally empty hostel to cook a nice dinner and get to know yourself and loneliness a little bit better.
<br/>
​<br/>

And help yourself to the "free"??? nugatti in the fridge.
<br/>
​<br/>

God Natt!
​

## DAY 2:

​
Wake up at your normal time. Probably a nice and early 11am. The sun is already risen, done half a days work, and ready to greet you.
<br/>
​<br/>

The hostel is silent, and you're beginning to wonder if you remember how to speak. So you state your routine aloud for no one to hear. Good news, your chords still work like they should.
<br/>
​<br/>

Contemplate the viability and worth of renting a bike.. then remember that it's March, Windy, cold, and that cool Bike lift that Trondheim has is closed because it's off season.
<br/>
​<br/>

Walking it is?
<br/>
​<br/>

Time to find somewhere to eat. Trondheim is one of the Gastronomic capitals of Norway. Boasting Incredible Norwegian inspired cuisine and multiple Michelin star establishments.
<br/>
​<br/>

"But, Chance," you'll say. "You're on a budget. How do you choose what to spend your money on?"
<br/>
​<br/>

Easy!

<br/>
​<br/>

Very Poorly
<br/>
<br/>

* CREDO RESTAURANT AND BISTRO
* TO ROM OG KJØKKEN
* EMILIES – AN EATERY
* BAKGÅRDEN BAR & SPISERI
* BAKKLANDET SKYDSSTASJON
<br/>
<br/>

To name only a few. Then, remember you're slowly running out of money and can't afford any of them.
<br/>
​<br/>

Wander around Bakklandet, admiring all the potential cuisine, and expensive dining options, and become frustrated and tell yourself.
<br/>
​<br/>

"F\*\** this, you're traveling, it's your last day, you'll never be back here again. You're gonna enjoy it!" Hastily walk into Bakklandet Skydsstasjon, confused, and say:
<br/>
​<br/>

"Um, I'm hungry and don't know what I'm doing" mostly because there's no menu, no host, and an assortment of foods you've never seen before no less than 2ft to your right.
<br/>
​<br/>

Someone will then look at you, also confused, explain in half English half of whats going on, order the most mediocre Chicken Curry of your life for $20 and only afterwards ask about the buffet you should have gotten instead.
<br/>
​<br/>

Once you've eaten, what is probably a quarter of your fill, walk it off, of course, down past BAKKLANDET where it meets Vollafallet along the shore of the Nidelva.
<br/>
​<br/>

Here, you can see couples holding hands to remind you of what could have been and admire the river.
<br/>
​<br/>

Contemplate taking a ferry out to the highly praised **Munkholmen**, an islet in the center of the **Trondheimfjord** where public executions were held 1000+ years ago, only to realize that ferry service only runs during the summer season, and find somewhere else to go.
<br/>
​<br/>

As the night approaches, walk up, literally, towards **Kristiansten Fortress**. A strategic military location used to fend of some Swedish invasion, with a cool view of the city.
​

</div>
<div class="article-text">
​
If you're in the mood for an even better view, continue your trek up the sloping hills to Tyholttårnet.
<br/>
​<br/>

At the top of this spire is the best view of the city and surrounding area, free to ascend. Spend your last night watching the sun descend behind the mountain vista, where the staff won't say a word to you because you look too lonely... and need to charge your phone.

</div>

</div>

<div class="article-text">

Trondheim is a uniquely captivating city, wholly worthy of your visit, especially, probably in the summer months, with an appropriate budget and time. You should enjoy all this city has to offer. From hiking to boat tours of majestic fjords and islands, take advantage of some of the best cycling infrastructure that Europe has to offer.
​<br/>

And please eat all the food that I couldn't.
