I wanted to kick off these new articles with a city that left a lasting impression during my time spent. Weaving between neon markets, bustling streets, and dancing skylines you’ll find food cultivated through decades of western influence and economic necessity. Culinarily captivating, Hong Kong is worthy of your visit and attention.

## Dim sum - Tim Ho Wan and Michelin star masterpiece.

<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9AHnmngZKYr2njSE9" target="_blank">9-11 Fuk Wing St, Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong</a>

</div>

</div>

<div class="article-text">

There are many, but none compare to the original in Sham Shui Po.
 Take a bus, walk, run, piggy back, etc..

</div>

<div class="article-text">

Sure, it’s not the most amazing dim sum you can buy, but the price is unbeatable, and you’ll get to mark a Michelin star `struant off your bucket list.

Upon entering you'll be handed a daunting menu and a pencil to mark your selections. You'll have no idea what to get. Any dumplings are a safe bet.

</div>

<div class="article-text">

Get the baked pork buns, 3 of them. You’re welcome.

## The ORIGINAL mammy pancake

<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/KV2E3crZ2abpv1vYA" target="_blank">8～12 Carnarvon Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong</a>

</div>

<div class="article-image">

![bubble waffle](https://ucarecdn.com/92d2e9c5-8904-4304-8a8d-661d567bfafe/-/crop/2268x1804/0,690/-/preview/-/enhance/100/-/sharp/19/-/resize/1000x/-/quality/lighter/ "bubble waffle")

</div>

<div class="article-text">

I’m sure at this point you’ve either seen, had, or heard whispers of bubble waffles.

Sorry. They all pale in comparison to this immaculate eggette. Perfected technique and trained cooks means you'll get a crispy, gooey perfected treat every time. Personally, you can’t beat the original or Banana Chocolate.

## A communal hot pot - Haidilao

<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ycvwC4Bvs7MGVJ1d8" target="_blank">Kowloon Building, 2/F & 3/F, 555 Nathan Rd, Yau Ma Tei, Hong Kong</a>

</div>

<div class="article-image">

</div>

<div class="article-text">

This fun “do it yourself” meal is great or frustrating for the whole family, or friends, or rag tag group of strangers. Boiling broths cook up your choice of ingredients while you exchange stories or stare into the void.

</br>

Yeah, it's messy. Most people have no idea how long to cook things. You'll figure it out.

And at this particular location, if you order some noodles, they come to your table and fling stretch one live, in your face.

## Dessert soups - Hoi Kee Walnut Place

<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fL9XcNpY7HF5unUf9" target="_blank"> 212 Sai Yeung Choi St S, Mong Kok, Hong Kong
</a>

</div>

<div class="article-image">

![hong kong dessert soup](https://ucarecdn.com/442ee908-abe7-42a4-9b0b-79ab62ec1bc9/-/crop/3692x1944/0,0/-/preview/-/enhance/50/-/sharp/14/-/resize/1000x/-/quality/lighter/ "hong kong dessert soup")

</div>

<div class="article-text">

A bit more of an oddity, this one. Similar to dessert bowls in South Korea, but far more adventurous and distinctive. Smash together any number of ingredients, including, but not limited to, jellies, egg things, fruits, ice chips, water, milk, chocolate, beans, and you’ve got the idea. 

This stuff is everywhere. Bring some friends and try a couple late into the night.

## Street food - duck, buns, rice cakes

<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GWpdXgJ3QkRb7zyC6" target="_blank">Mong Kok, Hong Kong</a>

</div>

<div class="article-image">

![hong kong pineapple bun](https://ucarecdn.com/3eede8ca-f3e0-423b-a142-098a6c52b2fd/-/crop/2268x1762/0,1056/-/preview/-/enhance/50/-/sharp/17/-/resize/1000x/-/quality/lighter/ "hong kong pineapple bun")

</div>

<div class="article-text">

Just go to Mong Kok and try an array of goodies. This area of the city is lined with stalls, markets, street food abound. Definitely get the Peking duck, pineapple bun, and cheung fun, or steamed rice rolls. Despite the name, pineapple buns possess similarities to this fruit in name alone. Soft, sweet, cheap. Get 10. 

## Egg tart on the Main Island

<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nSzBKpMMAmg6pSwp6" target="_blank">Shop 1, G/F, Fuk Sing Court, 378 Queen’s Road Central, Sheung Wan, Hong Kong, 2543 3020</a>

</div>

<div class="article-image">

![hong kong egg tart](https://ucarecdn.com/82acbfff-9549-4081-a9b1-1f6d75a4e900/-/crop/1620x1471/536,1314/-/preview/-/enhance/18/-/sharp/17/-/resize/1000x/-/quality/lighter/ "hong kong egg tart")

</div>

<div class="article-text">

Glossy, semi sweet, definitely made of egg. Not my favorite treat in the world, but enough of a unique aspect of Hong Kong food culture to get my recommendation.

## A sandwich at Australia dairy company

</div>

<div class="article-text">

I know what you’re thinking….

</br>

“Wtf?”

</br>

Bear with me…

</br>

A quintessential culinary mix of west and east. Some of the best scrambled eggs in my life, with the oddest atmosphere of diner tables graced by late night businessmen and workers. I don’t really recommend the bowls of basically Campbell's chicken soup, but the sandwiches are prettty dope.
