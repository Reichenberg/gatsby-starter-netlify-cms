The "San Francisco of South Korea" is how the articles I researched seemingly loved to refer to Busan. Boasting beaches, markets, temples, massive shopping centers, and all the amenities your typical beach based would be expected to bear. 

</br>

It's sprawling, broad, and coastal. That means it takes forever to get anywhere. Mostly, you care about the beach, for at least a day. So, stay in Haeundae. It's got sand and water. Perfect for a nice stereotypical stroll in the mid-afternoon sun. 

</div>

<div class="article-text">

## Day 1:

Strap on those trusty $2 flippy flops from the local convenience store, there are so many, and shuffle on down to the beach where all that water and sun is, hopefully. Bask in the Korean sun, taking in the local views of oddly placed statues, boats, and the ... everybody taking selfies.

</br>

If you happen to be walking north along the beach passed the skyscrapers. Keep doing it. You'll come across Dijmae Hill, hopefully, teeming with shops and cafes, probably. I didn't make it there.

</br>

Come back down along the beach, but stop as you come to a suspiciously wide section of road that ends at Haeundae Station. This is where you'll find Haeundae Market, housing more fish on the brink of death than the local aquarium that I didn't bother with because I've seen enough fish in my life.
</br> 
They will also have your personal favorite Tttoebokki and fried chicken! 

Continue towards the station and on your left you'll see a sign for a pretty neato shop called "Cafe Moon."

</br>
These egg and cheese concoctions are at least worth the novelty. And all of this should leave the ole wallet in pretty decent shape.
</br>
So no guilt! Cool!
</br>

<div class="article-text">

Finish it up by heading over to Thursday Bar. Games and cheap alcohol are the commodity, and once again, cheap. If you're still conscious, walk along the beach at night and you might catch some fireworks. 

</br>
Or
</br>
Drop by one of the stalls and light some up yourself. 
</br>
Unless you're a scaredy-cat.

## Day 2:

You've basically seen all there is to see of Haeundae....

</br>

So, how about some coffee, window shopping, and the cheapest day spa, or jjimjilbang, you'll likely ever find in your entire life that everyone keeps talking about that you're determined to go try?

</br>

Yes?

</br>

Good

</br>

Using your trusty metro card (Which you've surely purchased at this point.) Head on down to Seomyeon station from Haeundae. It's a bit of a journey, so be sure to wake up a little to late, just to be unsure all day about your ability to fit everything in before your flight. 

Blackup Coffee is your first stop.

</br>

Walking in, make sure to assume there's no english menu, when there is certainly one right in front of you at the register. You'll order a drink and cheese cake and bring your order to the barista behind you.

</div>

<div class="article-text">

Enjoy the atmosphere and oddly fantastic cake. Then step out into the streets to window shop for all the essentials you can't possibly fit into your bag.

</br>

 Oh, you need new shoes? 

</br>

No, the one's you want are expensive here. 

</br>

**MOVE ON - CENTUM CITY IS NEXT**

</br>

The largest department store ON. THE. PLANET.

</br>

And that spa you've been waiting for.

Shinsegae!

</br>

Don't take a photo. It's too big anyway.

</br>
Upon entering you'll most likely be on the ground floor (not the first floor).
Meander your way through the many stalls of expensive perfumes and luxury goods, and you'll eventually come to a fairly obvious hallway marking your first objective.

</div>

<div class="article-text">

Disappointment awaits those bearing permanent scars in the form of ink laden skin.
</br>
**TATTOOS ARE NOT PERMITTED IN THE SPA.**

</br>

**BE FOREWARNED FOR I WAS SADDENED DEEPLY.**

</br>

The only cure is to drown your sorrows in the massive food court adorning the basement floor of this shrine to capitalism. An assortment of creative confectionery, deliberate delicacies, and Korean craft. Not the most frugal end to a Centum City excursion, but you've got money left from your disappointing spa visit. 

</br>

You'll most certainly reach your fill. Head farther down in Shinsegae and you'll eventually run into something your childhood self dreamed of.

</div>

<div class="article-text">

Continuing back to Haeundae, spend a relaxing night along the beach and the markets, admiring the illegal fireworks and beach-side fish market. You might never return.
