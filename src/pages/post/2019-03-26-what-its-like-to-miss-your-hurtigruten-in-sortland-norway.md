I awoke, to an announcement, from what had been the deepest sleep I've had in weeks, thanks to a CABIN I HAD ALL TO MYSELF. We were approaching Risoyhamn. 

<br/>

A channel the Norsk used to use horses to cross at low tide. Instead, it has been dredged to allow larger ships to pass... with a generous 3 meter depth of clearance. The channel has to frequently be re-dredged.

<br/>

"If this were summer it would be great for whale watching." The charismatic crew-member announced. I did not share his enthusiasm.

<br/> 

I'm easily the youngest person on this ship, where by my assessment, the average age is rapidly approaching 98.

<br/> 

I noticed this as I was perusing the on-board store which housed "knit" sweaters that would require some families to save every cent for no less than 2 years to afford.

<br/>

## Then, came the port at Sortland.

I decided I had wasted enough on shitty ferry fair. I'm gonna hop off the ship and buy my own assortment of overpriced goods. I. Was. A. Genius.

<br/> 

I thought

<br/>

Over the now familiar intercom, the same crew-member announced in a myriad of languages, for the old people, that ship would be docking soon and would depart IN ONE HOUR'S TIME.

<br/>

"PERFECT" I thought to myself. "Plenty of time." No. No. No.

<br/>

Meandering towards the supermarket, I took several moments to admire the tiny town and the scenery this clearest of days afforded to me.

I eventually made it to the Bunnpris where I would acquire my bounty and now a conditioned fear of check-out lanes. Once I perused ever so calmly and picked my assortment of goods, peanuts and 2 Gala apples, I entered the queue. I happened to notice it was rather long, and the line next to me was about to open up. "Statistics show that changing lines increases wait time. I'll stay." STUPID. 

<br/>

## 10 Minutes later

<br/>

**Still. In. The. Line.**

<br/>

I am one from the register as the thoughts creep in. "Did they mean one hour from docking or one hour from the announcement." ...

<br/>

The man in front of me had.

1. CHOSEN THE ONLY BAG OF SPINACH IN THE WORLD WITHOUT A BAR CODE.
2. HAD HIS CARD DECLINED
3. PURCHASED CIGARETTES
4. USED THE LAST OF THE PAPER IN THE REGISTER.

There is currently a maelstrom of frustration and anxiety brewing in me the likes of which this cigarette smoking spinach man has heretofore never encountered.

<br/>

On this outside. Cool as a cucumber.

<br/>

As my boots touch ice, I sprint in the direction of the dock.

<br/>

Stress mounting as I approach the port. "Wouldn't it be insane if the ferry was pulling away as I round this corner?" My heart sinks. I sprint ever so calmly with my nuts and apples through the terminal, hop a fence, and approach the first person who looks like they know more than me.

<br/>

Through labored breaths:

<br/>

**"THAT'S \*GASP\* MY SHIP. DO YOU KNOW THE NEXT PORT."**

<br/>

"Stokmarken"

<br/>

**"How can \*GASP\* I GET THERE"**

<br/>

"You need taxi"

\--p.s. Uber is banned in Norway and my phone is not connected to any form of internet.

<br/>

"I can call you taxi?"

<br/>

**"YES, TUSEN TAKK"**

<br/>

"Shit happen, walk through terminal and wait."

<br/>

This, most obviously, retired taxi driver with minimal aptitude with English and, probably, arthritic foot to pedal he expedited our trip as best he could. Weaving in and out of traffic, through construction vehicles and over bridges. Something akin to Vin Diesel in Fast and Furious 78.

<br/>

We arrived with time to spare. One bag fewer peanuts and $84 less. 

<br/>

I've lost 2 years of my life. I took a nap.

<br/>

Turns out I picked the best port to miss.
