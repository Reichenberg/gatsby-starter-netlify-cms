  This isn't in order, but I gotta get it out there. Traveling is nothing
  without a chain of 76 hours that feels like the longest day of your life.
  Here's one of mine.

## Total Travel Time: 62 hours

As I write this I'm sitting on a cramped bus next to a very attractive Norwegian man while possessing a sleep debt even a grad student would pity.
<br/>
But fresh experience begets rich scenes... someone said once.
Moreso because my memory is evocative of a goldfish.

<br/>

**START**

<br/>

## Sleep Debt: -8

<br/>

I didn't sleep. Not that I didn't do my best. I do suffer from this fun bit of intermittent insomnia. Mr. Sandman is no where to be found when he is most missed. I stared at the ceiling the night prior to my departure. Reality set in and nerves took hold. I'm leaving a life I've made. 

<br/>It's not the first time, it surely won't be the last. 

Not that that makes leaving those most important to you any easier.<br/>

Aside from all the dramatic weight this last drive held, it was pleasant and heavily laden with all the vehicular karaoke my friends certainly loved. From Knox to Ashe was my goal, and I only left 20min late.

<br/>

The airport was what you would expect. It had security, planes, and even food. I took an awkward amount of time taking off my boots and the woman next to me just laughed. So I went ahead and joined her.

<br/>

My plane buddy consisted of an aspiring life coach with questions abound. We exchanged stories of travel and nuggets of wisdom acquired through all the typical channels of failure and mishap. 

<br/>

<br/>

Then nap #1 struck and my consciousness faded.

<br/> 

Then I was in New York. A 13 hour layover was ready to greet me.

<br/>

## Sleep Debt: -6

<br/>

<br/> 

I was to meet a friend! A friend whom I've seen in person for a whole 5min prior. That's a story for another time!

Newark to Manhattan was my current goal. I've done that enough times, its like ... easy now. I should do an article on that?

This brief dip into the BIG APPLE consisted of a normalcy for me... 

<br/>

Find a coffee shop.

<br/>

Work on a thing.

<br/>

Specifically this blog

Various complications meant that my friend and I would have almost 2 hours to catch up before I would very much feel a deep urgency to catch a train to my next flight.

After goodbyes were said. Next was the long haul flight. To my surprise I was seated next to someone from Tromso and a girl working in New York from Germany. With Stories shared, I did my best to pay of my debt.. of sleep. On what will now be known as my least accommodating flight. 

<br/>

## Sleep Debt: (-6)-8+4 = -12
