  This isn't in order, but I gotta get it out there. Traveling is nothing
  without a chain of 76 hours that feels like the longest day of your life.
  Here's one of mine.

## Total Travel Time: 62 hours

As I write this I'm sitting on a cramped bus next to a very attractive Norwegian man while possessing a sleep debt even a grad student would pity.
<br/>
But fresh experience begets rich scenes... someone said once.
Moreso because my memory is evocative of a goldfish.

<br/>

**START**

<br/>

## Sleep Debt: -8

<br/>

I didn't sleep. Not that I didn't do my best. I do suffer from this fun bit of intermittent insomnia. Mr. Sandman is no where to be found when he is most missed. I stared at the ceiling the night prior to my departure. Reality set in and nerves took hold. I'm leaving a life I've made. 

<br/>It's not the first time, it surely won't be the last. 

Not that that makes leaving those most important to you any easier.<br/>

Aside from all the dramatic weight this last drive held, it was pleasant and heavily laden with all the vehicular karaoke my friends certainly loved. From Knox to Ashe was my goal, and I only left 20min late.

<br/>

The airport was what you would expect. It had security, planes, and even food. I took an awkward amount of time taking off my boots and the woman next to me just laughed. So I went ahead and joined her.

<br/>

My plane buddy consisted of an aspiring life coach with questions abound. We exchanged stories of travel and nuggets of wisdom acquired through all the typical channels of failure and mishap. 

<br/>

<br/>

Then nap #1 struck and my consciousness faded.

<br/> 

Then I was in New York. A 13 hour layover was ready to greet me.

<br/>

## Sleep Debt: -8+2 = -6

<br/>

<br/> 

I was to meet a friend! A friend whom I've seen in person for a whole 5min prior. That's a story for another time!

Newark to Manhattan was my current goal. I've done that enough times, it's like ... easy now. I should do an article on that?

This brief dip into the BIG APPLE consisted of a normalcy for me... 

<br/>

Find a coffee shop.

<br/>

Work on a thing.

<br/>

Specifically this blog

<br/>

Various complications meant that my friend and I would have almost 2 hours to catch up before I would very much feel a deep urgency to catch a train to my next flight.

After goodbyes were said, next was the long haul flight. To my surprise, I was seated next to someone from Tromso and a girl working in New York from Germany. With Stories shared, I did my best to pay off my debt.. of sleep. On what will now be known as my least accommodating flight. 

<br/>

## Sleep Debt: (-6)-8+4 = -12

</div>

<div class="article-text">

I awoke to goodbyes and a snow covered landscape. Oh, and the urgency of locating the "busterminal" quick enough to also stuff my face with something akin to food. As luck would have it, words don't tend to change and there were signs abound.

<div class="article-text">

Goals accomplished, bus ridden, all that was left? 

<br/>

20 hours more of train ride (thanks to delays)

<br/>

* Gothenburg, found my train.
* Big ole family with three kids and baby were my temporary friends
* THEN A TRAIN DINNER (curry noods)
* did a SLEEP: 5 hours of 'em!
* And a goodbye after I was done pretending to sleep
* Calm, quiet car with myself and the Swedish countryside for 5 hours.

<br/>

## Sleep Debt: -12-8+5 = -15

## BODEN to ABISKO, Sweden

After switching trains from my comfy cave to a full car, my next stop was Abisko, sweden... in no less than 5 hours. As it happens, snow tends to build on the tracks in this climate. This has the added consequence of delaying trains that are on said tracks.. my train in particular, of course. I was gifted with nearly 2 hours of delays.

<br/>

At least the views were captivating.

<div class="article-text">

* "Ostra? My stop? I don't think so" It Was.
* "Turistation. Sounds familiar." It was the wrong one.
* Cause STF wasn't my hostel, I only found out after helping an elderly Australian lady with her luggage and gracefully losing my footing **no less than 3 times** on the ice in front of 5 strangers.
* Oh 3km, cause my hostel was back at the last stop. **Thanks reception**
* cool, I'll walk that in the dark and -15. no prob
* I am gonna buy those show spike tho, plz thank you.

After all of this, I was greeted by a pair of wonderful french hostel mates and tea already prepared in a pot.

<br/>

They had seen my confused, sleep deprived self get off at the right station, then mistakenly get back on the train to warmly ride to the incorrect stop further into the national park and away from our shared hostel.

<br/>

I had made it.

<br/>

## lessons learned:

<br/>

## Always prepare offline maps, reservations, and directions.

<br/>

## Dress appropriately.

1. ## Ice is slippery.
2. ## Sweden is cold.

<br/>

## Final Sleep Debt Count: -15

<br/>

## Hours traveled: 62

<br/>

## Cinnamon buns eaten: 2
