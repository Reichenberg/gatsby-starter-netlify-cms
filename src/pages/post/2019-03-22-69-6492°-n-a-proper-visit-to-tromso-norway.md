  The hunt for the Aurora ends on a melancholy note. Leaving was harder than I
  had thought it would be, but a booking is a booking when it's almost $300.

I've left Tromso after a busy week of interaction. A lovely city of snow and scenery. A cold exterior with a warm heart. 

<br/>

My last day. A long night turned into a short walk. Greeted by a morning vista, the sky was clear and the path icy. Stumbling back was... treacherous. You never realize how dangerous ice is until you literally crawl up a path using a rail in broad daylight. Embarrassment has nothing on sliding down a 30 ft. slope into traffic.

With 10 minutes to check out, I ran into some recent friends leaving the hostel. Despite the invite, I was unable to join since every bit of my soul craved hot water. Packed, I cleaned up and made moves to lunch. Another friend whose sleep patterns more endearingly mimicked my own detailed her plans to hike to the Tromso South Beach. Without any immediate plans of my own to speak of, I agreed to join. 

<br/>

A "quick" jaunt and handful of conversations later, we made it to said beach; however, upon arrival, we notice a pair of individuals who look familiar. Coincidentally it was a couple of the hostel mates from earlier. The ones whose invitation I had declined! We regrouped and shared various cookies while overlooking the vista.

<br/>

Through the day, I had considered staying a modicum longer. Surely there was more to do, and the people I had met were a fantastic bunch, but I had a ferry (**Hurtigruten**) to catch at 1am, and there was no re-booking. Instead, we all made plans to chase the lights one last time. We cooked dinner and made plans to reconvene around 7:15.

<br/>

Of course I was late, sprinting back, I nearly died no less than 3 times (thanks ice). 

<br/>

We were headed to the cable car, over the Tromso Bridge and past the Cathedral. 

Once again I was reminded that proper attire is crucial.... however, I had made it a week without a proper jacket... and if I was stubborn enough to refuse buying one this long... I wasn't gonna break on my last night in negative temperatures.

<br/>

Nearly 25 minutes later, we reached the Fjellheisen (**cable car, aerial tram, one of those**) that ascended the nearby  mountain. Turns out heights do wonders for views and fleeing city lights.

The view turned out to be a spectacular one. Beset by darkness and graced by the city below. The lights made their showing, as did the stars. Fjellheisen is a must see. I only wish I had taken the time to see the city during the daylight hours. I guarantee it would be equally as breathtaking.

We were ushered home by the cold. One in our group thought it a fantastic idea to begin throwing snowballs. Fantastic idea! Until you're reminded that snow is water. and water has a tendency to solidify under the right conditions. As it turned out, those conditions were as followed: 

<br/>

## BE COLD

<br/>

It was that.

<br/>

A member of our group was then nailed in the back of the head by an ice ball approximating the size of a well developed melon. Can you guess who was happy? No one. It was no one.

<br/>

Once this situation was resolved, we made our way back home via ice covered streets, windswept alleys, and hesitantly angled slopes.

<br/>

As the night waned and my departure grew closer, I was sent off with Italian chocolates and hopeful plans to meet in the future. I was to catch a ferry and start a new journey.
